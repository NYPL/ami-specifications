# Preservation of grooved discs
Author: Seth Winner, adapted for GitHub by NYPL

## Rehousing
* All discs must be rehoused into acid-free and lignin-free buffered paper sleeves approved by NYPL.
  * If the disc is glass based, a piece of red tack down tape should be affixed below the class mark that should wrap around the envelope, making it visible once it is returned to its storage shelf. If the disc is damaged in some way (i.e.: cracked, broken, chipped, etc.) a piece of blue tack down tape should be placed below the red one in the same fashion.
* Barcodes must be duplicated and affixed to the upper-left hand corner of the new sleeve.
* Any IDs should be copied from the old sleeve to the new one in the upper right hand corner
* All original materials (including old sleeves) must be returned to NYPL at the conclusion of the project.

## Cleaning
Discs must be cleaned according to procedures appropriate for their base type, detailed below.  

### Cleaning and rehousing of shellac, shellac-vinyl compound, and vinyl discs
* Cleaning and drying must be carried out with equipment suitable for archival discs.
* Clean each disc with a solution of distilled water and Photoflo 200 or 600, The Disc Doctor’s “Miracle Cleaner”, or comparable solution.

### Cleaning and rehousing details for glass and aluminum based discs
* Discs that appear to be relatively clean and in good condition may be cleaned using a standard archival disc-cleaning machine.
* Glass and Aluminum based discs which exhibit “Palmitic Acid Syndrome” must be hand-cleaned.
  * Aluminum discs: Oxidation may be gently wiped with mineral or castor oil and a lint-free cloth, prior to gentle hand-washing
  * Glass discs: Oxidation may be cleaned with a solution of non-scented detergent and PhotoFlo (or comparable product approved by NYPL)
  * Hand-wash with a solution of non-scented liquid soap and PhotoFlo; rinse with lukewarm water; repeat as needed on both sides; vacuum and dry discs as normal.

### Digitization equipment and calibration

* Styli requirements:
  * shellac based discs and “Victrolac” manufactured late 1920’s - early 1940’s: Use a truncated styli that measure between 2.5 mil and 3.5 mil in size that are available in both conical and elliptical shapes.
  * Later vinyl pressings (ca. end of WWII to the early-mid 1950’s): Use a stylus range of 1.5 mil to 2.5 mil in the same variety of truncated assemblies.
  * The compliance of the cantilevers employed in the stylus assemblies should be able to withstand a tracking force of up to 7 grams for proper playback.
    * MODERN LP STYLI ASSEMBLIES MUST NOT BE USED FOR PLAYBACK OF THIS MATERIAL. DAMAGE COULD BE DONE TO THE GROOVES OF THE DISCS BEING PLAYED BACK IMPROPERLY.

* Phono Pre-Amp requirements    
  * Playback requires an archival phono preamp that can replicate a variety of playback curves, i.e.:
    * TimeStep
    * KAB Electronics
    * OWL I

  * **Note: RIAA Phono cartridge pre-amps do not meet our specifications and must not be used.**

* Analog to digital converter requirements
  * An A/D converter must be used to perform digitization.
  * **Note:Computer sound cards alone are not sufficient for the A/D conversion; they employ switching power supplies and lower quality filter components that severely compromise their performance.**

* Determining eligibility for playback:
Before digitization, inside grooves must be tested for any noticeable “swaying” from side to side of the tonearm head. If that problem cannot be resolved by readjusting the disc on the turntable after the turntable is stopped and restarted, that disc cannot be captured and must be added to the 'Did Not Capture' report with notes.

* Determining playback stylus and playback curve:
  * Refer to the “Handbook for Sound Engineers – The New Audio Cyclopedia” (Howard W. Sams & Company; Part 5, Chapter 23. http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/78rpm_playback_curves)

  * When determining the proper stylus assembly and playback curve panned to mono to cancel out any vertical noise, rumble or “stereo” groove noise.
